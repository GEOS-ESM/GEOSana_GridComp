REASON FOR CHANGES
------------------
Changes are made to the gsi code for the following reasons:  
(listing  below not given in any particular order)

 a) Fix minor bugs and clean up (simplify) code

 b) Add logic to identify and skip over bad NOAA-17 SBUV data

 c) Simplify and make more efficient the data handling, setup, 
    int and stp routines.  Specific changes: 
     - Move cg_term into constants rather than qcmod.
     - Make surface type consistent for satellite data throughout processing
     - Update radinfo file to include more info and to be simpler
     - Update ozinfo file to include more info and to be simpler
     - Simplify data input and parallelization routines
     - Update pcpinfo file to include more info and to be simpler
     - Make obs time window included in read group data namelist and 
       make consistent usage throughout code.
     - Combine setup,prep and spr routines for conventional data and 
       eliminate transpose.
     - Combine location and weight arrays in obsmod into single arrays 
       to improve efficiency.
     - Fix bugs in set up of refractivity data.
     - Some changes in data selection
     - Temporarily fix regional problem for intelligent thinning of data

 d) Tune regional observation error table based on adaptive tuning experiments.

 e) Change time window in regional_convinfo.txt file to 1.5 hours (was
    3.0 hours.  1.5 hours is consistent with 3 hourly cycle of regional
    data assimilation system)

 f) Regional mode bug fix --> set ozmz values

 g) Turn off ozone channels in regional_satinfo.txt since regional model
    does not carry ozone as a prognostic variable

 h) Expand dynamic constraint term, making using of generalized tendency
    routine.  Code may be applied in both global and wrf_nmm regional mode

 i) Fix bug in update_guess routine

 j) Fix bug in setupsrw which gave incorrect diagnostic output

 k) Fix date handling in setupsrw to be same as other data type read routines

 l) Add ability to read and process AMRSE and SSM/IS

 m) Correct bug in vertical coordinate flag (IDVC) in NCEP sigma file header



SPECIAL NOTES
-------------
The following points should be noted with regards to the above
code changes.  The lettering below corresponds to the 
"REASON FOR CHANGES" for lettering above:

 c) New input files radinfo, ozinfo and pcpinfo.  For some obs types 
    no test data was available, so it is possible that errors still 
    exist for rw, srw, and dw data.  For diagnostic files for each 
    conventional type, it was intended that there few changes.  
    However some are possible, and complete testing of the diagnostic
    files was not complete.  For the surface pressure data, the  
    correction due to differences in surface height were added to 
    the simulated ob rather than subtracting from the observation.

 h) use the Jc term at your own risk, as it is yet to be fully tested
     - turning the Jc term considerably increases the wall clock time
       (average increase:  2x to 3x longer than no constraint run when
        using same # of tasks)
     - The memory requirement for the Jc term is significant, so 
       attemping to run on large domains could be problematic, do 
       so with this in mind.
     - There is a significant impact on the minimization when the 
       Jc term is on, more iterations than normal may be required
     - For global gsi runs the constraint may be turned on when
       using either the NCEP sigma or hybrid vertical coordinate.
     - For regional gsi runs the constraint may only be turned on
       when in the wrf nmm mode, not the mass core mode.

***********WARNING WARNING WARNING***********
***NCEP GSI USERS PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING***

The following changes have occurred in the name and location of
GSI fix files:  

 a) Global fix file "prepobs_errtable.global.short" has been renamed
    "prepobs_errtable.global" in order to be consistent with the 
    name that is used in NCEP operations

 b) The GSI fix directory, /nfsuser/g01.1/weather/wx20rt/gsi_anl/fix,
    now contains sub-directories from which you may pick up version
    specific fix files.

    The directory names found in /nfsuser/g01.1/weather/wx20rt/gsi_anl/fix
    correspond with the source code directory names used in
    /nfsuser/g01.1/weather/wx20rt/gsi_anl/sorc

    For example, the latest GSI release is always found in 
    /nfsuser/g01.1/weather/wx20rt/gsi_anl/sorc/gsi_cvs.  The fix files
    associated with this GSI release are found in 
    /nfsuser/g01.1/weather/wx20rt/gsi_anl/fix/gsi_cvs

    Source code for the GSI release dated YYYYMM is found in directory
    /nfsuser/g01.1/weather/wx20rt/gsi_anl/sorc/gsi_cvs.YYYYMM.  The
    fix files corresponding to this version of the GSI code are in 
    /nfsuser/g01.1/weather/wx20rt/gsi_anl/fix/gsi_cvs.YYYYMM

    Fix file directories will NOT be maintained indefinitely.  Users
    are encouraged to make personal copies of the appropriate fix file
    directory if they will be working with a given version of the GSI 
    code for an extended period of time (>12 months).

    GSI source code and fix file directories for older version (more
    than one year old) will be moved to the NCEP CCS tape storage 
    system.

    Starting with this release, NCEP GSI users will find the following
    three GSI fix file directories
      1. /nfsuser/g01.1/weather/wx20rt/gsi_anl/fix/gsi_cvs
      2. /nfsuser/g01.1/weather/wx20rt/gsi_anl/fix/gsi_cvs.200508
      3. /nfsuser/g01.1/weather/wx20rt/gsi_anl/fix/gsi_cvs.200510

    The fix files in these directories correspond to source code in
    /nfsuser/g01.1/weather/wx20rt/gsi_anl/sorc/XXX as explained above.

***NCEP GSI USERS PLEASE NOTE THE ABOVE***

EXPECTED DIFFERENCES
--------------------
The following differences are expected when comparing GSI output from
this release from that from previous releases.  The lettering below 
corresponds to the "REASON FOR CHANGES" for lettering above:

 c) Non- roundoff errors exist because of:
     - bug fixes for refractivity data (previous version did not 
       correctly minimize J_ref term, current version does so)
     - small changes because of slight changes to numbers in ozinfo 
       file (a few of the last digits were rounded off)
     - Differences in land sea mask for satellite data
     - Emissivities now handle percent surface types and mixed surfaces
     - Some changes in radiance data selection for thinning
     - For regional should be some change in use of satellite data due 
       to temporary fix of surface field problem
 d) New regional error file improves analysis quality and forecast
    skill.
 h) No impact if jcterm is set off.  Analysis obviously differs if
    constraint is turned on

MAKEFILE CHANGES
----------------
The following changes are made to Makefiles:

 a) Makefile
     - Remove files from "FILES REMOVED" list
     - Add files under "FILES ADDED" list

 b) Makefile.dependency 
     - adjust dependences related to removed, added, and modified files



SCRIPT CHANGES
--------------
The folowing changes are made to rungsi_*.sh script files:

 a) The namelist obs_input has an additional time_window namelist 
    value for specifying the time window for each input obs group.
    Quality control namelist values have been removed and put into 
    *info input files.

 b) AMRSE and SSM/IS changes
     - increase jpch from 556 to 592
     - increase ndat from 35 to 40
     - add entries 36-40 in OBS_INPUT namelist for AMRSE and SSMI/S
     - add copies of AMRSE and SSM/IS datasets.  Please note that 
       neither AMRSE nor SSM/IS is available in the test cases
     - expand concatenation of radiance diagnostic files to include
       AMRSE and SSM/IS

 c) new namelist variables for JCOPTS
     - remove bamptend
     - add bamp_pse, bamp_uve, bamp_uvi, bamp_tin

 d) new location for GSI fix files as outlined in the SPECIAL NOTES
    section above.  This change only affects NCEP GSI users.

The following additional change is made to the rungsi_regional*sh scripts.
 a) Make use of regional_satinfo.txt file.  This file is identical to 
     global_satinfo.txt with the exception that the regional satinfo file
     turns off (puts in monitoring mode) channels with a strong ozone 
     sensitivity.  This is done because the current NCEP WRF NMM does
     not carry ozone as a prognostic variable.

The following additional change is made to the rungsi_global.sh script
 a) Rename conventional observation error table from 
    "prepobs_errtable.global.short" to "prepobs_errtable.global".
    This change was made to be consistent with the name used in
    NCEP operations.

NOTES:
   a) runs new1,2,3 test the constraint term.  These runs use the following
      JCOPTS settings:  jcterm=.true., bamp_pse=10000000.0, bamp_uve=1000000.0,
                        bamp_uvi=100000.0, bamp_tin=100000.0, damptend=1.0
      Please note that the bamp* values above are not tunned.  They are simply
      nonzero values used to exercise the code.  As expected, running with the
      constraint increases the maximum resident set size and wall clock time.
      Increasing the number of mpi tasks counters this.  Improvements to the
      constraint code are already being tested and show noticeable reductions
      in the wall clock time.
   b) difference in initial total penalty is mostly due to changes related
      use of brightness temperature data
