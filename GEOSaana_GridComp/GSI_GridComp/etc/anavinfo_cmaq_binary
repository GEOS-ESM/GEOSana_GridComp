# NOTES:
#   1) Except for ps, other meteo-fields should not be
#      required, but code needs to learn what needs to
#      be bypassed when reading guess from file.
#   2) Derivative and tendency tables are not provided
#      intentionally; make sure namelist does not refer 
#      to PCP observations, and has TLNMC turned off.
#   3) Notice that something in this anavinfo file
#      makes no sense -- it has met_guess with fields
#      with 30-levels and pm2_5 with 72 levels above.
#      I have not corrected this, but a fix is required.
