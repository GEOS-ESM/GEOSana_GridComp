rad_time_thinning_options::
! ptime:      Time interval (hour) for thinning radiance and ozone data.
!             It defines the number of time thinning bins (time_window/ptime).
!             0, only one time thinning bin, by default.
! ithin_time: Time preference is given 
!             1, (default) at the center time when thin4d=false, or 
!                observation time is ignored when thin4d=true. ptime must be 0.0;
!             2, at the center of time intervals (suppressing thin4d);
!             3, at the end of time intervals (suppressing thin4d);
!             4, at the beginning, middle, and end of the 1st, 2nd,and 3rd two-hour 
!                time interval, respectively. ptime must be 2.0 (suppressing thin4d);
!             5, select observations at random time, and ptime must be 0.0
!                (Only applicable to seviri data, May 2018).
! ptime=0.0 and ithin_time=1 by default if the observation type is not listed here.
