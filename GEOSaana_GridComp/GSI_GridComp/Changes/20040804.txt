REASON FOR CHANGES
------------------
   Changes are made to the gsi code for the following reasons

      a) Reduce memory requirements for thinning satellite data

      b) Allow inclusion of conventional SST observations (not tested)

      c) Addition of interface to allow connection with the WRF MASS CORE
         model.  This change pertains only to the regional system

      d) Generalize transform from earth lat-lon to model grid coordinate.
         This is necessary, because in regional mode, the WRF mass core uses
         a lambert conformal grid.  The new code figures out how to
         transform automatically from supplied earth lats and lons of
         the model grid (these fields are currently available in the
         WRF restart files for both NMM and MASS CORE).  This change
         results in medium changes for all regional runs.  This change
         only pertains to the regional system.

      e) There was a problem with noisy vorticity increments in the top layers
         when running in global mode.  The following change was made to the
         code to address this problem:  Redefine lookup table for coefficients
         of recursive filters.  The table is defined for just the scales needed
         locally in each PE and the increment of the table is in unit of scale 
         instead of 1/scale.  To be safe, the size of the table is also 
         increased (less than 1% increase in total memory)

      f) Negative horizontal scales were found in the polar patches (global mode) 
         due to sharp gradients near the coast line.  The following quick, 
         temporary fix is made to address this problem:  Remove sea-land contrast
         on horizontal scales for surface temperature (sst,ice,land).

      g) Convert some doc blocks to protex-compliant form (only done for a few 
         routines, still needs to be done for majority of routines)

      h) Improve emissivity models over snow/ice for AMSU-A/B

      i) Subroutine tbalance.f90 was using qsatg, not qsatg_fix, to
         normalize q.  Array qsatg saturation specific humidity) is 
         updated on each outer iteration.  Array qsatg_fix, as it's
         name implies, is held constant throughout the analysis.  We
         should use the fixed saturation specific humidity when 
         normalizing q in the minimization. 

      j) The logic around the call to set_ozone_var in glbsoi.f90 was 
         incorrect.  Routine set_ozone_var, found in berror.f90, scales the 
         ozone background error, held in array dssv, based on a global mean
         ozone profile (computed from the guess).  The background error array 
         dssv is defined and applied on subdomains.  However, the glbsoi.f90
         logic around the call to set_ozone_var only rescaled the ozone 
         background error on those tasks which horizontally smooth ozone.  
         For the remaining tasks, the ozone background error remained that 
         which was set in prewgt.f90  Thus, we had a mixture of unscaled 
         and scaled versions of the ozone background error being applied 
         in hoper and htoper.  The background error needs to be rescaled on 
         all tasks. 

         This bug explains why we obtain different results when running the 
         same case using different numbers of mpi tasks. 

      k) Bugs were found/corrected in the ozone diagnostics (setupoz.f90).
         Routine stpcalc.f90 is also updated, though, the bug in array indices 
         was on a write statement that is commented out in the code. 

      l) Remove horizontal (1-2-1) smoothing of tropopause pressure.  The 
         smoothing was done on subdomains and, thus, different smoothed 
         values were obtained along the edges of the adjacent subdomains.
         This created a mpi task number dependency on the results.  By
         removing the horizontal smoothing this dependency is removed.
         The tropopause pressure is used in setuprad.  It was decided that
         adding the communication needed to smooth the field globally (ie,
         independent of task id) was not worth the extra wall clock time.

      m) The indexing of arrays in intoz and stpoz was altered from 2-d
         to 1-d, thereby, making these routines consistent with other
         int* and stp* routines.  Variable names in intpcp, intrad,
         stppcp, and stprad were changed to be consistent with other
         int* and stp* routines.

      n) Logic was added to deter_subdomain, deternpe, sub2grid, and
         grid2sub to handle the case of periodic (east-west periodic)
         subdomains.  Given the current algorithm in deter_subdomain
         this only occurs when running the gsi with a single mpi task.
         In this case the previous code did not correctly handle 
         observations that fell between the last (western-most) and
         first (eastern-most) analysis grid points.  deter_subdomain
         and deternpe were altered to detect this periodicity.  
         sub2grid and grid2sub were altered to correctly manipulate
         the grids in this situation.



SPECIAL NOTES
-------------
   a) If you are NOT thinning satellite data AND there are more than 
      2.e6 observation profiles, you must change the value of itxmax
      in satthin.F90

   b) As noted above, the reading/prep/analysis of SST observations
      has not yet been tested since the data is not available.  This
      capability should be tested in the near future.



EXPECTED DIFFERENCES
--------------------
   a)  The largest difference comes from the improved emissivity model over
       snow/ice for AMSU-A/B.  The new emissivity model results in a large
       increase in the number of AMSU-A/B observations that pass quality
       control and are, thus, used in the analysis.  Almost all the additional
       data used is found poleward of 60 degrees latitude.  This additional
       data has its greatest impact on the polar lower troposphere.

   b)  The qsatg_fix bug fix to tbalance.f90 only affects the moisture analysis.
       The overall impact is slight.  It does, however, remove poor convergence
       issues for certain cases.

   c)  The ozone background error bug fix to glbsoi.f90 has a minor overall
       impact.

   d)  Differences in analysis results from changes of the filter coefficients
       and changing the scales of the SST and sfc temp.  Visually, pre- and post-
       change results are similar.

   e) Regional only
       - change to general coordinate transformation results in differences
         somewhat larger than roundoff and also results in small changes
       - observations closer to the edge of the model domain are allowed
         in the analysis.  The increase in observations processed by the
         analysis changes the minimization so differences are seen not only
         along the model domain edges but over the entire domain.

MAKEFILE CHANGES
----------------
   a) Makefile 
       - rename bufr library export procedure (GMAO-specific change)
       - fix doc target
       - The following routines are added -
           emiss_ssmi.f90, fill_mass_grid2, iceem_amsu.f90, intsst.f90, 
           prepsst.f90, read_wrf_mass_files.F90, read_wrf_mass_guess.F90, 
           setupsst.f90, snwem_amsu.f90, sprsst.f90, stpsst.f90, 
           unfill_mass_grid2.f90, wrwrfmassa.f90
    
   b) Makefile.dependency 
       - update dependencies to be consistent with Makefile and module 
         use within routines



SCRIPT CHANGES
--------------
   a) Both global and regional
     - Increase ndat to 29.  data type 29 is conventional sst data.  The
       data is not yet available, but the script is updated to process
       the data when it becomes available.

   b) Regional only
       - Rename rungsi_regional.sh rungsi_regional_nmm.sh
       - Add rungsi_regional_mass.sh (runs the regional gsi using the mass core)
       - Namelist variables order_a2e, order_e2a, nsoil_regional removed.
       - Namelist variable wrf_mass_regional added to allow use of wrf mass core model.
       - Namelist variables as(1), as(2), and hs changed to allow for new general
         map transform in regional mode.
           old:  as(1) = .1, as(2) = .1, hs = 1.
           new:  as(1) = .2, as(2) = .2, hs = 2.
