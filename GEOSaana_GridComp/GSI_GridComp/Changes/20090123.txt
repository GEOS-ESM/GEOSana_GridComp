Current status of testing various options: (Merge w/ NCEP-Dec08-Q1FY10 version)
------------------------------------------
I) Default minimization: working and giving meaningful results

II) sqrtmin-conjgr: working and giving meaningful results

III) adjoint of sqrt-congjr working and giving meansingful results

IV) observer is working

V) 4dvar is working (w/ Lanczos)

VI) FOTO works - results look somewhat suspicious.

VII) strong constraint opt 1 (slow) works in the context of pcgsoi  - gmao bkg
     strong constraint opt 2 (fast)       in the context of pcgsoi  - ncep bkg
     strong constraint opt 2 (fast)       in the context of pcgsqrt - ncep bkg


Various pending issues
----------------------

0) general remarks:
   - both NCEP and GMAO have removed _tl routines related to previous gsi-adjoint;
     To a large extent I picked GMAO's changes!
   - as a general practice to add a comment line in the prologue saying: "merged code from John Doe"
     is very uninformative!
   - prologues: what happened to agreement about protex?

1) quad: 
    - default: min is not reproducible (I broke it and my attempts to fix it have not yet worked)
    - sqrtmin: 
         o pcgsqrt: reproducible with one outer iteration
                not reproducible for two or more outer iterations (radiance bias correction suspect)
                      (intjo is not exaclty as it should be for quad fix)
         o congrad and all: not yet complete - lanczos/qnewton/qnewton3 will need minor change in
                            calc of dot products

2) routine-by-routine comments:
   - iasi  (prologue of setup??!)
   - stp3dvar/stpjo/stpcalc  need to clean redundant comments
   - int3dvar/intjo/intall   need to clean redundant comments
   - mp_compact_diffs_mod1.f90 somehow dec08 version gives me all sorts of 
                                problems - upded back to older version
   - smoothrf.f90  from dec08 not taked: I don't want to have to upd adj/sqrt accordingly
                                        (I would not be able to test omp split at this point)
   - GSI_gridmod.F90: must remove dependence on mpeu
                      must use kinds
   - setuprhsall.F90: Why does the setup routines depend on compute_derived? 
                      I'd like to move the call from setuprhall back to gblsoi
   - gsi_inquire in mpi_bufr_mod can be made smarter
   - timermod needs ibm corresponding timing routines

3) need to build consistency checks: l_foto/lsqrt, l_foto/l4dvar, ltlint, etc ...

4) Must update ESMF main program to handle NCEP background files

5) strong_bk and its adj need to be cleared from var transforms (such as calc 3dp, etc)

6) precipitation: 
    - read_pcp time (tdiff/t4dv) seems to be inconsitent w/ other reads
      (somehow nobs change considerably in setuppcp - likely at time window error in the read_pcp)
 
7) do I need mpl_allgather?

8) both control and state vectors modules need some clean up

9) double check time window of obs intake (particularly, read_prepbufr) in 4dvar

10) need to teach write_gfs how to write increments

11) OMI cannot be taken in 4dvar mode: read_obsdiags is the likely suspect

Minors:
======
a) I am sure Jing can answer the question in inquire_obsdiag(obsmod) about precision ...

b) took smoothrf from 4dvar - assuming smoorthrf changes in the May08 are simply computational

c) Commiting temporary pcgsoi on the truck ... bypassing Jing's change for TLNMC - will need to 
   bring it in later. Now, this entails a module m_tlnmc - which does not comply w/ module names in 
   GSI - must be named tlnmcmod - sorry Jing.

d) double check meaning of diagprefix replacement by dirname in light of adj/scripts

TAGS:
=====

A. First functioning merged tag: rt-gsi-d215_6-may08-4
    tested only for 2 outer 10/5 inner w/ TWPS raob 

B. Further tested tag: rt-gsi-d215_6-may08-5
    4dvar/observer working

C. Further tested tag: rt-gsi-d215_6-may08-6
    placed foto back

D. Tentative quad-precistion fix: rt-gsi-d215_6-may08-7
   also tested building gsi.x when ESMF not available
 
E. Initial December tag after committing NCEP Q1FY10 (as is) into GMAO
   repository: gmao4ncep-gsi-2008_12 (same as jg-gsi-nceptb_q1fy10-asis)

   Mildly modified Q1FY10 to work on the machines at Goddard: gmao4ncep-gsi-2008_12-4gsfc
     (this is the tag used for all comparisons below)

   Merged with Dec2008 NCEP version of GSI: rt-gsi-d215_6-dec08-4
     (missing O3)

F. Dec2008-plus version tested for all options with GMAO bkg: rt-gsi-d215_6-dec08-5
    (only strong constraint fast does not work - likely a pole issue)
     (missing O3, still)

G. Dec2008-plus version tested for all options with NCEP bkg: rt-gsi-d215_6-dec08-6
     (missing O3, still)

H. Dec2008-plus version tested for all options with NCEP bkg: rt-gsi-d215_6-dec08-7
     (now w/ O3)
     when using 100x100 iterations: sqrt converges, but default min has troubles
     (level O3 tested by Meta - seems ok)

F. rt-gsi-d215_6-dec08-9  this tag has pcgsqrt reproducible for single outer loop

G. rt-gsi-d215_6-dec08-10 (as in 9, w/ some clean up) - same as: gmao-gsi-2009_01
                                                                 pass to NCEP on 22Jan2009
                                                        after compilation fixes on IBM:
                                                                 gmao-gsi-2009_01p1

H. gmao-gsi-2009_01p2 after fixes to get results to match closely those from NCEP
   original code from Dec08. In this tag, results are very close for 1 outer iteration
   w/o precipitation data. There is still an issue w/ precip (see item 7)
    
F. gmao-gsi-2009_01p3 same as in gmao-gsi-2009_01p2, but add level o3 - and trying to 
   fix issues w/ precip (not done yet)

G. gmao-gsi-2009_01p4: pass to back to NCEP on 26Jan2009 after verifying that results
   reproduce very closely results from original code gotten from NCEP in Dec 2008 
   (which was at the name named Q1FY10)

I. gmao-gsi-2009_01p5: tested mls o3 and gps in 4dvar mode; 4dvar mode cannot 
   handle single level ozone such as OMI (will check)

J. gmao-gsi-2009_01p6: as above, but with original gmao interface removed

K. gmao-gsi-2009_01p7: remove redundancy between glbsoi and observer
        NOTES: (i) opt ltlint for pcgsoi is not given proper results  
                   linearization of stp routines has a problem - to be revisited
               (ii) pass to NCEP on 5Feb2009
