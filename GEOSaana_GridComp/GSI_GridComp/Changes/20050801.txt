REASON FOR CHANGES
------------------
Changes are made to the gsi code for the following reasons:  
(listing  below not given in any particular order)

 a) Added modules to interface with GMAO horizontal grid. In all
    platforms this adds dependency on other GMAO libraries (hermes,
    mpeu, transf, gfio, hdf, etc), except on AIX. This is a zero
    diff addition in the sense of when NCEP grid is used the code
    reproduces original result.

 b) Bug fix that now allows GSI to read two or more prepbufr files
    correctly. Tested by splitting a prepbufr file into two and 
    making sure results are as for when the single file is used 
    (zero diff change).

 c) Modify to use NOAA-18 and EARS data.  Remove satellite dependent 
    thinning criterion from read_bufrtovs, read_airs, and read_goesndr.  
    Changes made to thinning of AMSU-B observations.

 d) Modify to allow monitoring of observations (qc and compute innovations
    but do not assimilate).  Observations with quality marks of 9 and 14 
    will be monitored.  Changes printout to reflect stats for rejected 
    observations.

 e) In order to apply background error covariances calculated from 
    central NMM forecasts to the whole NA domain, sin(lat) is separated 
    from the balance projection

 f) Include both qoption=1 and =2 background error statistics in 
    single regional background error statistics file.

 g) Add OMI total ozone data as a data type that may be assimilated

 h) Update PINT: 3d non-hydrostatic pressure field, in regional NMM output

 i) Bug fix; allow regional background error statistics from a smaller
    domain to be used in a larger domain.

 j) Add preliminary code for dynamic constraint term

 k) Modify to allow specification of conventional data use through 
    convinfo file.  This file will control the use of observations 
    and specify gross and variational quality control quantities 
    for each observation type.  See file global_convinfo.txt file 
    for more information.

 l) Added capability to process level2 radar bufr files.



SPECIAL NOTES
-------------
The following points should be noted with regards to the above
code changes.  

   ****PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING****
   =================================
   With this update the name of the GSI executable is changed from 
   global_anl to gsi_anl.  The same GSI executable may be used for
   both regional and global applications.  The name "global_anl" 
   is not consistent with this generality.  The rungsi*sh scripts 
   included with the ncep-gsi-2005_08 CVS tag use the gsi_anl 
   executable name

The lettering below corresponds to the "REASON FOR CHANGES" for 
lettering above:

 a) Source code files m_utest.F90 and ut_fvAnaGrid.F90 are NOT
    REQUIRED to compile the GSI code.  These codes provide unit
    testing for the GMAO gsi interface routines (m_fvAnaGrid 
    and m_gsiGuess.
    
 f) With this update, regional gsi developers must use a new regional 
    background error statistics file --> one that includes statistics
    for both qoption = 1 and = 2.

 g) To use OMI data, 
       - namelist SETUP variable ndat must be increased by 1 
       - namelist SETUP variable jpch_oz must be increased
         from 52 to 53
       - namelist OBS_INPUT need an addtional line, "dfile()='omto3',...
       - rungsi script must copy OMI data to working directory

     ***WARNING TO GMAO USERS***
     gmao_global_ozinfo.txt assumes jpch_oz=52, not 53 (the new default)
     If gmao_global_ozinfo.txt is used at the input file, namelist SETUP 
     variable jpch_oz MUST be explicitly set to 53.

 j) With the addition of a dynamical constraint term, the number of
    penalty terms printed from stpcalc.f90 via the line
       write(iout_iter,100) (pbc1(i,1),i=1,ipen)
    is increased by one.  More significantly, the order of elements
    in the pbc1 array has changed from the previous gsi release.
    Values related to surface pressure have moved to the 20th position
    in the pen_bc and pbc1 arrays.  The 4th position of these arrays
    now contains values related to the dynamic constraint.  The table 
    below compares the previous and new ordering.

        term        previous ordering         new ordering

 k) Fix file global_convinfo.txt is a required input.  Please see SCRIPT
    CHANGES and FIX FILE CHANGES below

 l) Currently, at NCEP, the level 2 radar bufr files are very
    large (5-10Gb).  It is much too expensive to read and process these
    files using existing bufrlib routines.  Some new routines have
    been created which use mpi-io to read the files.  At the moment
    these routines are not mature enough to include in the operational
    bufrlib, but they are adaquate for the requirements of GSI.

    With this update, level2 radar data, if available, is processed near 
    the beginning of GSI execution, and converted to superobs which are 
    written in a format consistent with the already existing capability 
    for processing radar superobs from a binary input file.  If there is 
    no level2 file, the code will attempt to read superobs anyway, which 
    can be generated from older software already in use.



EXPECTED DIFFERENCES
--------------------
The following differences are expected when comparing GSI output from
this release from that from previous releases.  The lettering below 
corresponds to the "REASON FOR CHANGES" for lettering above:

 c) Differences in thinning of satellite data and thus differences
    in number of satellite data (usually more) that get through QC.
    Changes in AMSU-B thinning should allow more AMSU-B obs in system

 f) No differences in canned cases if the same background statistics 
    are used.  ("same" means using berror=regional_glb_berror.f77)

 j) Even if the dynamical constraint turn is turned off, differences
    in the order in which terms used in the step size calculation are
    summed, may lead to roundoff differences.  This roundoff error
    accumulated over the course of the analysis.  
 
 l) No differenc, unless a level 2 bufr file is provided.  Then differences 
    are common to those expected when adding a new data source.

SCRIPT CHANGES
--------------
The folowing changes are made to script files:

  a) analyzer 
       - modified to accommodate new GMAO interface for gridded fields
       - add assign for conventional observation info file 
         (gmao_global_convinfo.txt)

  b) Two new namelists are added for both regional and global gsi runs.
        JCOPTS - control dynamical constraint term (under development)
        SUPEROB_RADAR - control superobing of level 2 radar wind data 
     Please see comments in gsimain.F90 for further details

  c) With this release of the code, an additional "fix" file is needed
     to control the use of the conventional data within the analysis.
     The name of the conventional observation information file is
     global_convinfo.txt.  Comments at the head of this file explain 
     the contents of this file.  The GSI looks for a file named
     "convinfo" in the local working directory when run.  Both regional
     and global gsi runs need the conventional observation information
     file.

  d) Related to item c) above, the variational quality control parameters
     b_* and pg_* for conventional data are no longer specified via 
     namelist OBSQC.  Instead, these parameters are now set in the 
     conventional observation info file (convinfo).

  e) If running the gsi with level 2 radar wind data, the following
     line must be added to the script prior to executing the gsi

        ln -sf nexrad.bufr_d  l2rwbufr

     where  nexrad.bufr_d is a generic name representing the level 2 bufr 
     radar file that is to be processed by GSI.

     The internal file name expected in GSI is

        l2rwbufr for the bufr file



FIX FILE CHANGES
----------------
The following changes are made to fix files:

  a) regional_nmm_berror.f77 and regional_glb_berror.f77
      - regional gsi background error statistics file containing
        error statistics for both moisture analysis variables
        (qoption=1 and =2).  Note that the real words in this 
        file are of size 4-bytes, as the code expects
      - "nmm" statistics computed from NCEP NMN  
        "glb" statistics computed from NCEP GFS

  b) global_ozinfo.txt  
      - an extra line is added to the file for OMI data
      - NOAA-15 sbuv is removed and NOAA-18 sbuv is added
      - NOAA-17 sbuv data is turned on

  c) global_satinfo.txt 
      - update errors for all AMSU-A channels, AMSU-B channel 1,
        and all NOAA-18 MHS channels

  d) global_convinfo.txt
      - NEW file specifying information regarding conventional
        data

  e) gmao_global_convinfo.txt
      - NEW file specifying information regarding conventional
        data
      - identical with global_convinfo.txt for ncep-gsi-2005_08 tag
      
  e) gsi.rc.sample
      - add namelists JCOPTS and SUPEROB_RADAR
      - remove grossp from namelist OBSQC

NOTES:
   a) initial differences in penalty and gradient between old and new runs are
      due to differences in brightness temperature (Tb) thinning algorithms.  For 
      old run the total Tb penalty is 522324.059346757538 -vs 534460.252237925190
      for the new code (2.32% increase).  This is not unexpected since the new
      code also assimilates more Tb observations (old=861529 obs -vs new=891468, 
      an increase of 3.47%)
