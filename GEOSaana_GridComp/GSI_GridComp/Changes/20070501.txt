REASON FOR CHANGES
------------------
Changes are made to the gsi code,and script for the following
reasons:  (listing  below not given in any particular order)
C
NOTE: Code works in default 3d-var mode as it always did - expect
      minor result changes due to binning of observations

 a) Extended assimilation time window in preparation for 4d-var
 b) Redefined beginning of assimilation time in preparation for 4d-var
 c) Identified state and control vectors explicitly for 3d/4d-var
 d) Binned observation in preparation for 4dvar
 e) Add handle for SSMI f08, f10, and f11 satellites
 f) Special handle for 85Ghz channel in SSMI
 g) Reset weights when channels not used
 h) Add ESMF interface (ifdef'ed out) - only functional in presence of 
    ESMF-related relevant libraries
 i) Extended control vector to 4 dimensions (4d-var prep)  
 j) Add capability to process level data Ozone (MSL-ready) 



SPECIAL NOTES
-------------

 1) The ESMF interface has been implemented with a ifdef directive
    around the key points. The interface itself is in file GSI_GridCompMod.F90.
    This handles ANY background as long as the so-called analysis grid
    component and a main program are provided. These programs are
    data assimilation system-dependent; they are already available to handle 
    the backgrounds used in the global GSI. However, in the presence 
    of the ESMF interface, the main program no longer resides inside GSI;
    the make procedure in GSI simply generates a library. 
    
    The directive HAVE_ESMF controls the presence of ESMF - GMAO now uses
    GNU-compliant makefiles, named GNUmakefile; this file already has 
    the modification to handle the ESMF interface. The makefiles used 
    at NCEP and other places (Makefile.conf and Makefile) were left so
    that the ESMF interface is never involved/compiled.

 2) Although all the hooks are in place for MLS - when the merge of
    the MLS work and the observation binning work was done something clobbered
    the use of MLS and the data never actually gets to be assimilated.
    There is a bug somewhere but it still needs to be uncovered. This has
    no affect on results; particular when no MLS data in input - in the
    presence of MLS data the change in results in the last iteration of the
    second outer loop are in the fifth decimal place - the fields have
    insignificant spotty differences due to data reordering as a consequence 
    of the presence of MLS data; no impact in the when MLS absencent.


EXPECTED DIFFERENCES
--------------------
The following differences are expected when comparing GSI output from
this release from that from previous releases.  The lettering below
corresponds to the "REASON FOR CHANGES" for lettering above:

 d) Differences due to changes in binning of observations are very 
    minor, but unavoidable.
